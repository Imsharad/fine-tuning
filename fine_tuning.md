## Fine tuning a GPt-4o model



## Availability and Access

Fine-tuning for GPT-4o is now available to developers on all paid usage tiers[4]. 
To get started, you need to:

1. Visit the fine-tuning dashboard on the OpenAI platform
2. Click "create" 
3. Select "gpt-4o-2024-08-06" from the base model drop-down menu

## Pricing

The costs associated with GPT-4o fine-tuning are as follows[4]:

- Training: $25 per million tokens
- Inference: $3.75 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens

OpenAI is currently offering 1 million free training tokens per day for every organization through September 23, 2024[4].

## Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning process for GPT-4o involves several key steps[1][2]:

1. **Data Preparation**: Format your training data as conversations between a system, user, and assistant in JSONL files.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove errors and duplicates from your dataset.

3. **Data Upload**: Use the API to upload your prepared dataset.

4. **Create Fine-Tuning Job**: Initiate the fine-tuning process via the API, specifying "gpt-4o-2024-08-06" as the model and your dataset ID.

5. **Evaluation**: Once training is complete, test the fine-tuned model with sample queries to assess its performance.

6. **Iteration**: Retrain as necessary until you achieve satisfactory accuracy and relevance.

## Best Practices

OpenAI provides some recommendations for effective fine-tuning[1]:

- Start with about 50 well-crafted demonstrations
- Split your dataset into training and test portions
- Be aware of token limits (65,536 tokens for training examples context length for GPT-4o, with 128k coming soon)

## Benefits of Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning GPT-4o can provide several advantages[1][3]:

- Higher quality results than prompting
- Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt
- Token savings due to shorter prompts
- Lower latency requests
- Customized structure and tone of responses
- Improved performance for domain-specific tasks

Remember that fine-tuned models remain under your control, with full ownership of your business data[4]. OpenAI has also implemented safety guardrails for fine-tuned models to prevent misuse[3].

# Create a JSONL file


## Key Difference Between JSON and JSONL Format

The key difference between JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and JSONL (JSON Lines) format lies in how multiple data objects are structured:

1. **JSON Format**:
   - Represents a single object or an array of objects in one continuous structure.
   - Multiple objects are typically enclosed in a single array `[]`.
   - The entire file is one valid JSON object.
   - Example:
     ```json
     [
       {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
       {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
       {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
     ]
     ```

2. **JSONL Format**:
   - Each line represents a separate, complete JSON object.
   - Objects are not enclosed in an outer array.
   - Each line is a valid JSON object, and the file as a whole is not a valid JSON object.
   - Example:
     ```jsonl
     {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
     {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
     {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
     ```

JSONL is particularly useful for streaming data or working with large datasets, as it allows for easy line-by-line processing without needing to load the entire file into memory.


To format your training data as conversations between a system, user, and assistant in JSONL files, you'll need to structure each conversation as a JSON object containing an array of messages. Here's how to do it:

## JSONL Format for Conversations

Each line in your JSONL file should represent a single conversation, formatted as a JSON object. The conversation will contain an array of messages, each with a "role" and "content" field.

Here's a sample of how your JSONL file should look:

```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a knowledgeable history tutor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When did World War II end?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "World War II ended in 1945."}]}
```

## Breakdown of the Format

Let's break down the structure:

1. Each line is a complete JSON object representing one conversation.
2. The JSON object has a single key "messages" which contains an array of message objects.
3. Each message object has two keys:
   - "role": Can be "system", "user", or "assistant"
   - "content": The actual text of the message

## Roles Explained

- **system**: Provides context or instructions for the conversation. It's typically used at the beginning to set the tone or give the assistant specific behavior guidelines.
- **user**: Represents the human user's input or questions.
- **assistant**: Represents the AI assistant's responses.

## Sample Conversation

Here's a more detailed example of a single conversation:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant specializing in computer programming."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How do I declare a variable in Python?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In Python, you can declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it. For example:\n\n```python\nx = 5\nname = 'John'\n```\n\nPython uses dynamic typing, so you don't need to specify the variable type explicitly."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What about in Java?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In Java, you need to declare the variable type explicitly. Here are some examples:\n\n```java\nint x = 5;\nString name = \"John\";\ndouble price = 19.99;\n```\n\nJava uses static typing, so you must specify the variable type before the variable name."
    }
  ]
}
```

When creating your JSONL file, remember that each conversation should be on a single line, with no line breaks within the JSON object itself[1].

By formatting your data in this way, you'll have a structured dataset that clearly delineates between system instructions, user inputs, and assistant responses, which is ideal for training language models for conversational AI tasks.

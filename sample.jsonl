Here's an example:\n\nSELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName FROM Contacts)\nFROM Account\n\nThis query will return all Accounts and include a nested list of related Contacts for each Account. The subquery (SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName FROM Contacts) is enclosed in parentheses and placed in the main query's SELECT clause.\n\nIf you only want Accounts that have at least one Contact, you can add a WHERE clause with a subquery:\n\nSELECT Id, Name\nFROM Account\nWHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contact)\n\nThis query will return only Accounts that have at least one related Contact."}]}
